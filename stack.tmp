One js script has to display a map. 
This script need some data located in a file to be able to display some information on this map. 
This data is calculated by a php script and wrote into the file. 
But the calculation time is rather long.
How can I make the js script waiting for the php srcipt process ending before trying to display the map ?

The php script is called by:

    system("php create_file.php $fichier_json >/dev/null 2>&1 &");

The map display is called by:

    data.displayMiniMap = function(User, load) {
		data.http_d({ 	
			method: 'POST',
			crossDomain: true,
			data: {},
			headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'},
			url: '/getFranchiseDistance.php?dist='+this.distance+'&adr='+this.codePostal,
			crossDomain: true
		}).success(function(d) {
			var end =  new Date();  // log end timestamp
			data.minimap_franchise=d;
			var diff = end - start;
			console.log('COUCOUCOUCOUCOUCOUCOU')
							
			displayMap();
		});
	}
